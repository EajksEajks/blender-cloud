p.
	Here is some behind-the-scenes info! In order to define what you can do on Blender Cloud, we
	rely on a system of #[em roles] and #[em capabilities]. For example, every subscriber can use
	Flamenco, but only admins can create an Organisation.

p.
	Your roles are determined by multiple factors, such as being part of an organisation, being
	subscribed to Blender Cloud, etcâ€¦ Your capabilities are determined by the roles you have.

p.
	If the website does not work as expected, for example you received permission-related errors,
	it is often useful to mention what your roles and capabilities are when asking for support.
