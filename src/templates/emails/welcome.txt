Here is a quick guide to help you get started with Blender Cloud.


## Discover the Training Content

Our high quality training is organised in courses, where
experienced trainers teach you step-by-step specific techniques,
and workshops, where you get the feeling of peeking behind the
shoulders of an artist explaining their creative workflow.
